It should only launch for migration-specific login flows.",

Also added \"Skip this wizard\" link text for experienced users.\n\n2. **Conditional Launch Implemented**:\n   - URL parameter support: ?skip=true or ?direct=true\n   - localStorage persistence for skip intent across auth flow\n   - Referrer detection for internal platforms (admin, employees, changes, billing, support)\n   - Note: platform=aeims is decommissioned per user confirmation\n\n3. **Skip Logic**:\n   - Authenticated users skip directly to provider selection (step 6)\n   - Unauthenticated users store skip intent, redirect to login, then auto-skip on return\n   - Onboarding status tracked as 'skipped' in user profile\n\nCommit: f9dd359 - \"Add skip wizard functionality to migration portal\""
